    "INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bustling world of agricultural markets, where prices can fluctuate as wildly as the weather, understanding the dynamics of vegetable prices is crucial. Picture this: a farmer waking up before dawn, carefully tending to rows of vibrant green crops, each one representing not just sustenance, but livelihood. Yet, as the sun rises, so does uncertainty. Will the prices at market today yield enough profit to sustain the farm? Or will they plummet unexpectedly, leaving the farmer grappling with the harsh realities of an unpredictable market?\n",

    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and the Government of India, collects extensive data on vegetable prices across different regions in India. However, the lack of comprehensive analysis and insights derived from this data hinders effective decision-making in the agricultural sector. Therefore, the primary problem addressed in this project is to analyze the vegetable pricing trends over a one-year period, leveraging the available dataset. Specifically, the analysis aims to identify patterns, trends, and factors influencing price fluctuations in various types of vegetables across different regions. By addressing this problem, the project seeks to provide actionable insights that can inform policymakers, farmers, and traders, facilitating better decision-making and optimization of pricing strategies, supply chain efficiency, and risk mitigation in the agricultural mar\n",
